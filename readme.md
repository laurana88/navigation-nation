# Navigation Nation
Seventh project for JavaScript Web Projects: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio

The project focuses on creating an animated navigation that slides in and matches the color of the section it jumps to on this simple one-page website. This project utilizes Google Fonts, Unsplash Images, [W3 Schools Menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_menu_icon.asp), and [Paletton color selector](https://paletton.com/).

The main purpose of the project was to learn how to place and animate a navigation menu with CSS and Javascript.
